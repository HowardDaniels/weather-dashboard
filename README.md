# weather-dashboard

This weather dashboard is designed to help travelers look at today's weather and a five-day forecast for a city of their choice with a responsive, easy-to-use interface.

The user types a city into the input and then presses the search button.

The top container provides a list the city name, an icon representing its current weather, the current local time and date, as well as the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index.

The bottom container provides a five-day forecast for that same city, showing the next five days (starting with tomorrow), the weather icon, temperature, and humidity. 

All units are displayed in both the metric and imperial systems for international applicability.

Users can see their recent search history displayed under the search input, and can click on the button with the recently searched city to display the weather information for that city again.
